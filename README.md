# odata-simple-query

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ NOT production ready ⚠️⚠️⚠️

This package is based on the [odata-query](https://github.com/techniq/odata-query). I created it because I want to:

- explore how [odata-query](https://github.com/techniq/odata-query) works under the hood
- experiment with different approaches to the same problem
- test a modern way of creating a npm package as described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh89VE3Mk5g)
